# Exam-score-Python

Using tkinter, write a Python program to display the following screen: Window, labels and text boxes and buttons:
Label ("Enter student full name")  Box()
Label ("Enter student score") Box ()
   Button ("Add) Button ("Clear")
Label ("Display all students scores")
Button ("Display)  Box()


Define functions to implement the behaviour, as follows:

- You should be able to enter names and scores in the text boxes. The program should save the data to an SQL database called ExamScore when the “Add” button is clicked.
- The “Display” button should get all the names and scores from the database and display them in the box (example below).
- The “Clear” button should delete any text in the three text boxes.
